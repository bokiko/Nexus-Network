# üöÄ Nexus Network - Simple Installation Guide for Testnet III

**STATUS: Testnet III is LIVE!** Join now and earn NEX Testnet Points and Tokens.

---

## üìñ What is Nexus Network?

**Simple explanation:** Your computer helps process blockchain calculations and you get paid in NEX Points for it.

**More details:** Nexus Network is like a giant worldwide computer made of thousands of normal computers (including yours!). When you join, your computer does small math problems to help verify blockchain transactions. You earn NEX Testnet Points that turn into NEX Testnet Tokens.

---

## üíª What You Need

### Your Computer Should Have:
- **Processor:** 4 cores or more (most modern computers have this)
- **Memory (RAM):** 8GB minimum, 12GB+ is better
- **Hard Drive Space:** 10GB free
- **Internet:** Must stay connected

### Best Performance:
- **Processor:** 8+ cores
- **Memory (RAM):** 16GB or more
- **Hard Drive:** SSD (faster than regular hard drive)
- **Internet:** Fast and stable

‚ö†Ô∏è **Low on RAM?** If you have less than 12GB RAM, your node might crash. Don't worry - we'll fix this by creating "swap space" (uses hard drive as extra memory).

3. You should see your node listed
4. It should show "Active" or "Online"

**If you don't see your node:** Try waiting 5 minutes and refresh the page.

---

## üîÑ STEP 9: Run Node 24/7 with Screen

**Why use Screen?** Right now, if you close your terminal, your node stops. Screen keeps it running forever!

### Create Screen Session

**Copy this command:**
```bash
screen -S nexus
```

**What happened?** You're now inside a "screen session" - a special terminal that stays running.

### Start Your Node

**Copy this command:**
```bash
nexus-network start
```

```bash
screen -r nexus
```
**Now you can see what your node is doing!**

**To leave again:** Press `Ctrl+A` then press `D`

### Stop Your Node Completely
```bash
screen -X -S nexus quit
```
**This kills the node.** Only do this if you want to stop earning!

### Restart Your Node
```bash
screen -X -S nexus quit
screen -S nexus
nexus-network start
```
**Then press:** `Ctrl+A` then `D` to detach.

---

## üîÅ STEP 11: Auto-Start After Reboot (Optional)

**Want your node to start automatically when your computer reboots?** Follow these steps!

**1. Open nano editor:**
```bash
nano ~/start-nexus.sh
```

**2. Copy this ENTIRE script and paste it:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Wait for system to boot up
sleep 60

# Stop any old sessions
screen -X -S nexus quit 2>/dev/null

# Start new node in screen
screen -dmS nexus nexus-network start

# Write log
echo "$(date): Started nexus node" >> ~/nexus-startup.log
```

**3. Save the file:**
- Press `Ctrl+X`
- Press `Y`
- Press `Enter`

### Part B: Make Script Runnable

**Copy this command:**
```bash
chmod +x ~/start-nexus.sh
```

### Part C: Test the Script

**Copy this command:**
```bash
~/start-nexus.sh
```

**Wait 60 seconds, then check:**
```bash
screen -ls
```

**If you see "nexus" in the list = Script works! ‚úÖ**

### Part D: Set to Run on Boot

**1. Open crontab:**
```bash
crontab -e
```

**If asked which editor:** Choose **nano** (usually option 1)

**2. Add this line at the bottom:**
```bash
@reboot /home/YOUR_USERNAME/start-nexus.sh
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:** Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual username!

**Don't know your username? Check with:**
```bash
whoami
```

**3. Save crontab:**
- Press `Ctrl+X`
- Press `Y`
- Press `Enter`

### Part E: Test the Auto-Start

**Reboot your computer:**
```bash
sudo reboot
```

**After computer restarts:**
1. Log back in
2. Wait 60 seconds
3. Check if node is running:
```bash
screen -ls
```

**If you see "nexus" = Auto-start works perfectly! ‚úÖ**

---

## üõü STEP 12: Fix Low Memory Problems

**Is your node crashing with "Out of Memory" errors?** Add swap space (uses hard drive as extra RAM)!

### Create Swap File (16GB)

**Copy these commands ONE AT A TIME:**

**1. Create the file:**
```bash
sudo fallocate -l 16G /swapfile
```

**2. Set permissions:**
```bash
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
```

**3. Format as swap:**
```bash
sudo mkswap /swapfile
```

**4. Turn on swap:**
```bash
sudo swapon /swapfile
```

**5. Make it permanent:**
```bash
echo '/swapfile none swap sw 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
```

### Check If Swap Works

```bash
free -h
```

**Look for "Swap:" line - should show 16GB**

**If you see 16G under Swap = SUCCESS! ‚úÖ**

Now your node won't crash from low memory!
